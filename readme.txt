# üíª Assignment 04: Simple Chatroom using Go RPC

This project implements a simple chatroom application using **Go's built-in Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** package, fulfilling the requirements of the assignment.

The solution is split into a Server (`server.go`) that stores messages and a Client (`client.go`) that handles user interaction.

---

## üöÄ How to Run the Application

The application requires two main components running concurrently: the server and at least one client.

### Prerequisites
* Go (Golang) must be installed on your system.

### 1. Start the Server (`server.go`)
Open the first terminal window and run:
```bash
go run server.go
(The server will start listening on port 1234 and will log all incoming messages.)

2. Start the Client(s) (client.go)
Open one or more additional terminal windows for the clients. For each client, run:go run client.go
(You will be prompted to enter a username. The client will run forever until you type exit or hit Ctrl+C.)

Interaction
Clients use bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin) to read the whole message, even if it contains spaces.

Each time a message is sent, the client displays the entire chat history (fetched from the server in the same RPC call).
‚öôÔ∏è Project Implementation Details (Simple Documentation)
This is a summary of the implementation details:

Server (server.go): The server registers the Chat service. It uses a long list (messages []Message) and a mutex (sync.Mutex) to store and protect the chat history concurrently.

RPC Mechanism: The Chat.SendMessage RPC method stores the new message and then returns the full, updated chat history to the client as a reply. This satisfies the requirement for the server to return the history when a message is sent.
